# Dot Organizer

Multi platform dot organizer

## How the "dotorg" command works

When dotorg is called a few things happen

1. Check if `git` and `python` are installed and fail otherwise
2. This repo is cloned into your user directory, under `~/.dotorg`.
3. You are asked to update the install script if you wish to
4. dotbot is run with the modified install

### Other subdirectories

* The `/pkg` directory has all packages that are linked or installed. All
  subdirectories are submodules and can be used by itself if needed.

## Installation

### OS X Notes

You need to have
[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=xcode) or, at the
very minimum, the [XCode Command Line
Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools),
which are available as a much smaller download.

The easiest way to install the XCode Command Line Tools in OSX 10.9+
pen up a terminal, type `xcode-select --install` and [follow the
prompts](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).

### Ubuntu Notes

Either way, you should at least update/upgrade APT with `sudo apt-get -qq update
&& sudo apt-get -qq dist-upgrade` first.

### Actual installation (for you)

1. Fork this repo
2. Open a terminal/shell and do this (change `ashkan2200` and `master` as
appropriate):
